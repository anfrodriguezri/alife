# Alife

This repository contains a C++ implementation of an artificial society in a Prey Predator environment including some Artificial Life models seen in the Artificial Life course offered at Universidad Nacional de Colombia by professor Jonatan Gomez (Semester 2018 - I). At the core of these models we can see evidence of emergence of behaviour from complex systems that use basic rules for local interactions.

The models included in the implementation are:

- Self-Similarity (L-Systems)
- Self-organized criticality (Sandpile)
- Social and economic behaviours (Sugarscape)
- Patterns (Turing Patterns with Reaction-Diffusion Models using Cellular Automata)
- Swarms and Collective Intelligence (Boids)

## Dependencies

- OpenGL for graphics (Tested with Freeglut)
- OpenCV
- SOIL.h implementation for reading images (by kbranigan)
