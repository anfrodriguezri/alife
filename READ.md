This repository contains an implementation of an artificial society in a Prey Predator environment including some Artificial Life models seen in the Artificial Life course offered at Universidad Nacional de Colombia by professor Jonatan Gomez (Semester 2018 - I). At the core of these models we can see the evidence of emergence of behaviour from complex systems that use basic rules of local interactions.

The models included in the implementation are:

- Self-Similarity (L-Systems)
- Self-organized criticality (Sandpile)
- Social and economic behaviours (Sugarscape)
- Patterns (Turing Patterns with Reaction-Diffusion Models using Cellular Automata)
- Swarms and Collective Intelligence (Boids)
